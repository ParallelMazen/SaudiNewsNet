Article Format
----------
Each article is represented as a JSON object stored in a file (file name format: newspaper-name-[some-id].json). All files are formatted in UTF-8.

The JSON object for each article Contains the following fields (notice that some fileds can have empty values in case the crawler failed to extract them):

 - **`url`**: The full URL from which the article was extracted.
 - **`title`**: The title of the article. Can be empty.
 - **`author`**: The author of the article. Can be null.
 - **`content`**: The content of the article.
 - **`date_extracted`**: The timestamp of the date on which the article was extracted. It has the format `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`. Notice that this field does not necessarily map to the date on which the article was authored (or made available online), however for articles stamped with a date of extraction after August 1, 2015, this field most probably represents the date of authoring.
